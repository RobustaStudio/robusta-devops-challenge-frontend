## Pre-requisites

- [node v12.0 or higher](http://nodejs.org/)

## Setup

Prepare your `.env` file by copying the contents of `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

After filling the `.env` content, you can proceed to installing dependencies.

## Development

Development requires installation of Javascript library modules using the [Node Package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The following command is run from the project's root directory.

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
